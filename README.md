# Chess

Chess engine in C++, using bitboards. Written for my A-level NEA CompSci practical project.

For reference, I have also uploaded sections 1 and 2 of the [documentation file](/Documentation.pdf). It is self-contained and provides context and explanation for this project. Note the bad formatting on page 15 because I couldn't recover the final version of the file.
